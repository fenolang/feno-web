            answer: 'Feno is a JavaScript extension, we dedicate a lot of time and effort to improve the language, make things easier for everyone, offer an alternative, a better version to create your project. Do you want to see what the benefits are and enjoy them? Use Feno.'

            name: "Can Feno work together with JS?",
            answer: 'Obvious! You can use scripts written in Feno together with other scripts written in JavaScript, but we honestly do not recommend it as it is not necessary, everything you can do in a JS file you can do in a Feno file and much better.'

            name: "I have a giant project in JS, can I easily migrate to Feno?",
            answer: 'Absolutely! You can migrate incredibly easy since Feno supports JS code, just run your project just as it is with Feno and it will run without any problems. Then in your time you can change the code to achieve a 100% project built with Feno ;).'
          },
          {
            name: "What do you think of TypeScript?",
            answer: 'We love TypeScript! In fact, the Feno core is built with TypeScript. Now, Feno and TS share certain characteristics and certain objectives BUT each one has a somewhat different central objective, Feno aims to offer the new features of web development (components, layouts, etc.), strong typing and a much easier syntax of Learn and remember as well as introducing new functions never seen before Feno has many functions that TypeScript does not. Why? because both point to something different BUT both have the objective of improving the web.'

            name: "Do I need a special editor or IDE to use Feno?",

            name: "Does Feno work in all browsers?",

            name: "Why does Feno work through instances?",
            answer: 'In the beginning of Feno, the best way to organize the code was through instances, so everything was divided into three parts and we maintained a correct cleaning. From version 2.0 this will change, so the intakes in Feno will no longer exist, everything will develop in one plane, which will make us write less, have to remember fewer things and the speed of Feno increases. Great, no?'

          {
            name: "Cubes are something new, what do they transpile?",
            answer: 'The Cubes are transpiled into code with parameters, the objective of The Cubes is that you no longer have to send and receive parameters to change the way your applications operate, but since browsers do not understand Feno code, the cubes are transpiled into code with parameters (as it is currently done). Starting with version 2.0, there are now vectors that are an improved version of cubes and without the errors that they presently present.'

            answer: 'We always try to improve Feno therefore if we find a better and more comfortable way to write some function we will make it possible BUT no change breaks the stability of your project, we do not like to break the compatibility so abruptly (Angular cof cof ..)'
